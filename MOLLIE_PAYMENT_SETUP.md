# ✅ Mollie Payment Integration - Complete Setup

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Payment Buttons Now Connect to Mollie** 💳
**Problem**: "Test Payment" buttons didn't create actual Mollie payments  
**Solution**: Created dedicated payment creation endpoint

**Before**:
- Buttons linked to sandbox page
- No actual Mollie payment created
- No redirect to Mollie checkout

**After**:
- Buttons link to `create-payment.php`
- Creates real Mollie payment
- Redirects to Mollie's secure checkout page
- Users can enter payment details

### 2. **Fixed Undefined Variable Warning** 🔧
**Problem**: `Warning: Undefined variable $is_admin` in navbar  
**Solution**: Added isset() check before using variable

## Testing the Payment Flow

### ✅ **Prerequisites**

   ```
   MOLLIE_TEST_API_KEY="test_DPnkq9mH3BgmWfJQJVwBpF9MjySf5F"
   ```

2. **Composer packages** installed:
   ```bash
   cd C:\xampp\htdocs\glass-market
   composer install
   ```

3. **Database table** `mollie_payments` exists

---

### Test 1: Free Trial (No Payment)

1. **Login** as regular user (not admin)
2. Visit: `http://localhost/glass-market/resources/views/pricing.php`
3. Click **"Start Free Trial"** on Trial plan
4. **Expected**:
   - Instantly redirected to homepage
   - See message: "Trial activated"
   - Subscription created in database
   - No Mollie payment screen (it's free!)

---

### Test 2: Monthly Payment (€9.99)

1. **Login** as regular user
2. Visit pricing page
3. Click **"Subscribe Now"** on Monthly plan
4. **Expected**:
   - Redirects to `create-payment.php?plan=monthly`
   - Then redirects to **Mollie checkout page**
   - See Mollie payment screen with:
     - Amount: €9.99
     - Description: "Glass Market - Monthly Subscription"
     - Payment methods (credit card, iDEAL, etc.)

5. **On Mollie page**:

6. **After payment**:
   - Mollie processes (in test mode, instantly approved)
   - Redirects to `mollie-return.php`
   - See success message
   - Subscription activated!

---

### Test 3: Annual Payment (€99)

1. Same as Test 2, but:
   - Click "Subscribe Now" on Annual plan
   - Amount shown: €99.00
   - Description: "Glass Market - Annual Subscription"

---

## Mollie Test Mode

### Using Test API Keys

With test API keys, no real money is charged:

1. **Visit Mollie checkout**
2. **Select any payment method**
3. **Enter test card details**:
   - Card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
   - Expiry: Any future date
   - CVV: `123`

4. **Payment instantly succeeds** in test mode

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Mollie is not configured"

**Cause**: `.env` file missing or API key not set

**Solution**:
1. Check `.env` file exists: `C:\xampp\htdocs\glass-market\.env`
2. Has line: `MOLLIE_TEST_API_KEY="test_DPnkq9mH3BgmWfJQJVwBpF9MjySf5F"`
3. No spaces around `=`
4. Restart Apache in XAMPP

---

### Error: "Mollie API client not initialized"

**Cause**: Composer packages not installed

**Solution**:
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\glass-market
composer install
```

Check `vendor/mollie/mollie-api-php` folder exists.

---

### Button Clicks But Nothing Happens

**Cause**: JavaScript error or redirect issue

**Check**:
1. Browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check if redirected to `create-payment.php`
3. Check error message on screen

**Debug**:
Add to `create-payment.php` top:
```php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
```

---

### Redirect to Mollie, But Then Back Immediately

**Cause**: Test mode auto-approves payment

**This is normal!** In test mode:
- Payment created
- Mollie shows checkout briefly
- Auto-approves
- Redirects back
- Subscription activated

**Real mode**: User would enter real payment details

---

### Payment Created But Subscription Not Activated

**Check**:
1. `mollie_payments` table has payment record
2. `user_subscriptions` table updated
3. Check `mollie-return.php` processed correctly

**Manual activation**:
```sql
-- Check payment
SELECT * FROM mollie_payments WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Manually activate subscription
UPDATE user_subscriptions 
SET is_active = 1, end_date = DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID;
```

---

## Database Tables

### mollie_payments
```sql
Stores all Mollie payment records:
- payment_id: Mollie payment ID (e.g., tr_xxxxx)
- user_id: User who made payment
- amount: Payment amount
- status: open, paid, failed, etc.
- months: Subscription duration
- created_at: When payment created
```

### user_subscriptions
```sql
Stores active subscriptions:
- user_id: User ID
- start_date: Subscription start
- end_date: Subscription end
- is_trial: Boolean (free trial?)
- is_active: Boolean (active now?)
```

---

## Return URLs

### Success
```
http://localhost/glass-market/resources/views/admin/mollie-return.php?user_id=123
```
Mollie appends: `&payment_id=tr_xxxxx`

### Webhook (Background)
```
http://localhost/glass-market/resources/views/admin/mollie-webhook.php
```
Mollie calls this to update payment status

---

## Quick Commands

### Check Mollie Configuration
```php
// Visit: test-mollie.php
$mollie = new MolliePayment();
var_dump($mollie->isConfigured()); // Should be true
var_dump($mollie->getApiKey());    // Shows first 10 chars
```

### Check User Subscription
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_subscriptions WHERE user_id = YOUR_ID;
```

### Check Recent Payments
```sql
SELECT * FROM mollie_payments ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Manually Create Test Subscription
```sql
INSERT INTO user_subscriptions (user_id, start_date, end_date, is_trial, is_active)
VALUES (YOUR_ID, NOW(), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH), 0, 1);
```
