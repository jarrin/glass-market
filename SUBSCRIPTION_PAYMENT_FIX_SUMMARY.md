# Subscription Payment Fix - Complete Summary

## Date: October 31, 2025

## Problem Statement

Users with expired trials could not subscribe due to a payment error:
```
Payment Error: [2025-10-31T09:59:42+01:00] We could not process your request due to validation errors.
Error executing API call (422: Unprocessable Entity): The webhook URL is invalid because it is
unreachable from Mollie's point of view.
```

## Root Cause

The Mollie API requires webhook URLs to be publicly accessible for payment status updates. The localhost URL `http://localhost/glass-market/resources/views/admin/mollie-webhook.php` cannot be reached by Mollie's servers, causing payment creation to fail.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Webhook URL Validation (CRITICAL FIX)

**File**: [database/classes/mollie.php](database/classes/mollie.php)

**Changes**:
```php
// BEFORE (Line 201):
$webhookUrl = 'http://localhost/glass-market/resources/views/admin/mollie-webhook.php';

// AFTER (Lines 201-203):
// For localhost testing, don't include webhook URL (Mollie can't reach localhost)
// In production, set this to a publicly accessible URL
$webhookUrl = null;
```

**Result**: Payments now create successfully in test mode without webhook validation errors.

### 2. Comprehensive Error Logging System

**Database Table Created**: `payment_errors`

Stores all payment failures with:
- User information
- Plan and amount details
- Full error messages
- Context (IP, user agent, session ID)
- Request data (JSON)
- Payment ID (if created before failure)
- Timestamp

**Migration**: [database/migrations/2025_10_31_create_payment_errors_table.sql](database/migrations/2025_10_31_create_payment_errors_table.sql)

### 3. Enhanced Payment Creation Error Handling

**File**: [resources/views/create-payment.php](resources/views/create-payment.php)

## Database Migration

The `payment_errors` table was created successfully:

```bash
php -r "
$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=glass_market', 'root', '');
$sql = file_get_contents('database/migrations/2025_10_31_create_payment_errors_table.sql');
$pdo->exec($sql);
echo 'Table payment_errors created successfully';
"
```

**Result**: ✅ Table created successfully
