      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Glass Market was born from a simple idea: to create a dedicated space where the beauty and artistry of
        glass could be celebrated and shared. We recognized that glass art, from delicate crystal pieces to bold
        contemporary sculptures, deserved a marketplace that understood its unique value.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as a small platform has grown into a thriving global community of artisans, collectors, and
        enthusiasts. Today, we connect thousands of sellers with buyers who appreciate the craftsmanship,
        history, and beauty of glass art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every piece on Glass Market tells a story‚Äîwhether it's a traditional Venetian vase crafted using
        centuries-old techniques or a modern art glass sculpture pushing creative boundaries.
